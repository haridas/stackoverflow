NOTE: LET US KEEP MULTI-BYTE CHARSETS ASIDE FOR EASY UNDERSTANDING.
Let us understand difference between String and Array of characters
In a byte of 8 bits we can store 0 to 255 if unsigned
-127 to +127 if signed

As a whole if we see a byte (8 bits) the value that can be fit into it is -127 to 255 (range).
The range of ASCII characters (32 to 126) are considered as printable characters.

Given character array a[10] if any of the bytes a[0] to a[9] has value out of the range of printable characters(above definition) then it is not a STRING, its just array of characters.
If all of the bytes fall within the printable characters range (32 to 126) then it is STRING.
In summary for array of characters the range can be any of (-127 to 255). So important conclusion is since printable characters (32 to 126) is proper subset of -127 to 255 All STRINGS can be called array of characters.

Now let us apply above to BINARY file vs TEXT file.

If in a file all bytes are in range of (32 to 96) it should be called TEXT file.
If any of they byte falls out of this range i.e (-127 to 31) or (97 to 255) then it is BINARY file.

In summary since (32 to 96) is proper subset of (-127 to 255) ALL TEXT FILES ARE BINARY FILES.

I have not verified the printable characters range, etc. But I am sure I made the point clear.

The reason behind the strange behavior is described in Richard Stevans book.

PRINTF PRINTS TO SCREEN WHEN
The job of printf is to write output to stdout buffer. kernel flushes output buffers when

kernel need to read something in. (EXPERIMENT #2)
or when it encounters newline (since stdout is by default set to linebuffered)(EXPERIMENT #3)
program exits and all output buffers are flushed (EXPERIMENT #4)


By default stdout set to line buffering
so printf will not print as the line did not end.
if it is no buffered all lines are output as is.
full buffered then only when buffer is full it is flushed.
